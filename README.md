# Girl, Interrupted

A computational study on the faces in the movies.
We examine both the fraction of time a face is detected, and the fraction
of scenes we detect a male or female face.

For example, consider Dirty Dancing, which features an even mixture of the two main characters, Pitch Perfect, a predominately female movie, and 12 Angry Men, a male dominated feature: 

**Dirty Dancing**, _1987_

**12 Angry Men**, _1957_

Each tick represents one second of the film, a pink mark for females is on top, and a blue mark for males is on the bottom.
